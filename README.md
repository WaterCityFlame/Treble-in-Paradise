# Treble-in-Paradise
A game about music. Made as a prototype for a class on UI design.

## Compile And Run
This is built on Java 1.8

Use 'javac src/*.java' to compile the code to .class files. Using 'javac -cp src/TrebleInParadise.java' is not likely to work, since there are multiple .java files.

Run the program with 'java -cp src/ TrebleInParadise'
